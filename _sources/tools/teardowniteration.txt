Teardown Iteration
==================

A module to hold actions for the end of a single test-iteration. All this seems to be doing is sleeping... I think the idea was to turn this into a composite but I moved on to the newer ape so this didn't make as much sense.



.. uml::

   BaseClass <|-- TeardownIteration

.. module:: apetools.tools.teardowniteration
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   TeardownIteration
   TeardownIteration.sleep
   TeardownIteration.run
