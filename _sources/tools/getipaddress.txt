Get IP Address
==============

A module to hold ip address finders. At the moment this only supports unix-like machines (it assumes the `ifconfig` command exists), since that's all I'm testing. It also requires the user to pass in a regular expression to find the value. It didn't occur to me until later that if I passed in the command as well this would be a general querier for any command, eventually this should go away.



This is the expression for linux machines (defined in the :ref:`expressions <apetools.commons.expressions>`_ module).

::

    inet\s+addr:(?P<ip_address>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})
    



and this is the one defined for android (also in the `expressions` module).

::

    ip\s+(?P<ip_address>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})
