Sleep
=====

.. _apetools-tools-sleep:

A module to hold a sleeping class. This isn't a True sleep but rather a block -- it sleeps for a given interval and then wakes up and reports the time remaining. I believe there's a better one around here that uses an `EventTimer`. This might be an artifact of the merging of this package with older code.
