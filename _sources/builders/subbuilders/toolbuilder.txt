Tool Builder
============

A module to aggregate the tool-builders.

.. note:: This will eventually be replaced by the importer class(es)

.. _apetools-tool-builder-enum:

The Tool Builder Enum
---------------------

It looks like the Enum is a red-herring. The *BaseOperationBuilder* is just getting properties from the *ToolBuilder* (using *gettattr*).

::

    class ToolBuilderEnum(object):
        __slots__ = ()
        ners = "ners"
        apconnect = "apconnect"
        timetorecovery = "timetorecovery"
        dumpdevicestatebuilder = "dumpdevicestatebuilder"
        iperf = "iperf"
        rotate = 'rotate'
        poweron = 'poweron'
        oscillate = 'oscillate'
        oscillatestop = 'oscillatestop'
        sleep = 'sleep'
        naxxx = 'naxxx'
        busyboxwget = 'busyboxwget'
        rotate_cube = 'rotate_cube'
    # end class ToolBuilderEnum
    
    



.. _apetools-tool-builder:

The Tool Builder
----------------

The `ToolBuilder` is used by the :ref:`BaseOperationBuilder <apetools-baseoperationbuilder>` to find the classes that build the code the user has requested in the configuration file. The names of the properties are what should be in the configuration file's [TEST] section.

.. '

For example, the `dumpdevicestate` is meant to run in the `operation_setup` phase, and `iperf` in the `execute_test section`, so the configuration file that declares it would have this in it (along with other things).
 
.. code-block:: ini

   [TEST]
   operation_setup = dumpdevicestate
   execute_test = iperf

With the values corresponding to `ToolBuilder.dumpdevicestate` and `ToolBuilder.iperf`.
